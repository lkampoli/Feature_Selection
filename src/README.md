# Exploration of feature selection algorithms

Several sources have have been used and constantly updated ...

## Scikit-learn algorithms
[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#rfe)

 * Removing features with low variance
 * Univariate feature selection
 * Recursive feature elimination
 * Feature selection using SelectFromModel
 * L1-based feature selection
 * Tree-based feature selection 
 * Sequential Feature Selection
 * ... TODO: add more or eliminate some ...
